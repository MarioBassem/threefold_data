Wealth is more than the accumulation of money and resources. It can be generated in ways other than through conventional financial means. The financial justice warrior, Bernard Liataer, highlighted that in order to capture the wealth of our societies, our culture and our environments, we have to pay heed to the notion of wealth as well-being.

But how do we obtain that well-being? We all know the answer to this question – we have a sense of well-being when all of our needs are met. Not just the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter but also the need to be a creative participant in our community, to have a voice in our own destiny and pursue our own spiritual development unhindered by social sanction. Developing real wealth implies making choices that enable all members of the community to attain well-being. Achieving sustainable wealth implies meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

The FairSwap has been created while taking into consideration the different types of community capital that need to be achieved to create real wealth: 

1. Natural Capital – It is the stock of environmental assets that produces more assets if natural capital base (essential regenerative capacity) is maintained. FairSwap provides a fair and transparent exchange of environmental goods and resources.

2. Technological Capital – It includes the ways we harness our intellectual resources to create tools, systems, machines, arts, skills, materials that are designed to improve our lives. This is what FairSwap is all about - enhancing our lives and those of our communities’ members through collective efforts and intelligence. FairSwap is only the foundation, as people will be able to support education, creativity throughout the world and give access to material information that are required to create additional innovative technologies.

3. Social Capital – It recognizes the economic importance of all the ways we are connected to each other: the relationships, our networks and values we share and the cooperative systems along with all its different components we use for interacting.

4. Historical and Cultural Capital – Through history, we have learned and now we are transmitting our cultural understanding, and recommendation about the economic and financial system to others, through an open-source, public and transparent peer-to-peer exchange protocol.

5. Human Capital – It includes all capabilities that people have to learn, invent, create, work, care for each other and to contribute to the community as a whole. The FairSwap will strengthen the communities’ human capital by developing strategies that increase capabilities on every level.

6. Financial Capital – It is the creation of real wealth through the availability of liquidity resources through a multi-currency system and Savings & Investments made by individuals and institutions. By strengthening and increasing this type of capital, our p2p exchange believes that it is the obvious path to a successful economic development.

7. Entrepreneurial Capital – It includes these businesses and organizations that mobilize all the other type of capital to produce the assets that meet human needs. On the FairSwap platform, these innovative companies will be able to raise funds and exchange goods/services with their customers, suppliers and peers.

8. Potential Exchange Capital – Through FairSwap, we believe that that multiple cooperative currencies need to intentionally work in parallel with the current international monetary system to effectively address global issues and create more stability and predictability in the financial and business sectors. This will provide a mechanism for contractual, payment and planning purposes within our community and worldwide.

All of these forms of capital produce the critical flows of assets through the economic system. Capital is the foundation, the reproductive system, the greenhouse that grows a healthy economy and this has been one of the fundamental belielf of FairSwap - For the well-being of worldwide communities.
