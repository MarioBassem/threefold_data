# Central America to Pioneer a Regenerative Financial Ecosystem

Integrity.Earth is proud to announce a launch partnership with SEEDS.

SEEDS is a pioneering a financial ecosystem and conscious digital currency designed to empower humanity & regenerate ecosystems.

Integrity.Earth facilitates the convergence of the regenerative society into a co-creative development processes that respects a holistic understanding of our interwoven-ness with life.

This partnership will catalyze the emergence of bioregional economies of abundance and will be instrumental to the five year plan to Solving
the Central American Migration Crisis through Regenerative Development.
Together, we will sustain a program of Regenerative Development through community empowerment, focused on restoring essential ecological corridors and addressing the systemic causes of the migration crisis. We are pioneering a whole-system transdisciplinary approach that combines proven frameworks of best practices in ecological restoration in conjunction with meeting the socio-economic needs of communities.

Central America, with a high potential for regeneration, offers a unique opportunity to effectively address a complex systemic failure that risks driving millions to emigrate from the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) and improve the resilience of Costa Rica and Panama through large-scale regenerative development.

Our pathway to restore ecological balance to the region while safeguarding the long-term livelihoods of communities starts with targeting essential biological corridors over a five-year period, where we intend to build capacity for broad impact, as follows:

Co-creating regenerative economies with all stakeholders through multidisciplinary solutions that build resilience at the local level.
Enhancing community building and participation, especially the capacity of youth, through empowerment and education.
Incubating entrepreneurs, cooperatives, and small enterprises, inclusive to women and youth, establishing value chains for sustainable market opportunities.
Developing regenerative agriculture programs that optimise food production through land-use-planning and the recovery of local agrobiodiversity, linked with local ancestral knowledge.
Developing regenerative tourism models and frameworks.
Facilitate access to innovation technology for rural communities (i.e. sustainable energy production) allowing for youth to identify with local development
Safeguarding and recovery of essential biological corridors that sustain biodiversity levels and build resilience to climate change.
We are proposing a far-reaching, long-term solution that consolidates existing and emerging efforts in the region working towards systemic integrity. This will open up a pathway for effective replication and scale, allowing all of us to converge around a well-being economy that sustains life.

We are all stakeholders of this planet. We look forward to co-creating a sustainable planetary culture with you.
