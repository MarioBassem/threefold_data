ThreeFold believes in 100% decentralization, for multiple (good) reasons. We believe that no single being can make decisions for a majority of people. From our daily operations to big decisions that determine the course of the ThreeFold Project we rely on reaching consensus amongst a majority of stakeholders before anything. Think of things like:
- Who should we partner with next
- What feature for Zero-OS is most pressing
- What profiles do we need to hire next
- What should our next marketing endeavor look like
- And so on.
<br />
<br />
ThreeFold is a project that influences not only the lives of the people working at ThreeFold, the people/companies using the technology, but also the people that use the services that others run on top of the technology. This means the effects of any decision made have a ripple effect that impacts a lot of people. For this reason, ThreeFold has instated Councils.
<br />
<br />
## Councils & Guardians
The Councils or Guardians consist of groups of people that are carefully selected within and outside of the ThreeFold project that makes decisions on impactful matters like:
Technology
Foundation Decisions
Running grid validation software
We involved people from outside of the project to bring a "real world" perspective to any decision. As the dedication level within the team is "pretty high" to say the least does make it that we sometimes live in a ThreeFold bubble. This is where people that aren't as involved help us step out of this bubble to reach consensus or majority vote that has had input from all angles.
