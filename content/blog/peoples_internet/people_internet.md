Today, the Internet’s infrastructure is generally controlled by large corporations. They own many of the hyper-scale data centers which generate the capacity that fuels all of our online actions – from visiting websites to streaming content to sending messages, and more.
<br/>
<br/>
But this makes a lot of people uncomfortable, nervous, and scared. All of our data and files are stored in those data centers – and thus we are left to trust the companies who own them to keep what is ours safe and secure.
<br/>
<br/>
Since 2017, a network of independent farmers has been plugging in 3Nodes from their homes and offices to create the backbone of a new planet positive and data sovereign Internet. 3Nodes are like the servers inside of a data center. They generate new capacity rather than relying on what exists. The key is that while farmers own the 3Node hardware, they do not own or even have access to the data inside. That data is uniquely owned by the person who put it there.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a much bigger story with some technical complexity, and we encourage you to dive in more in our wikis. But hopefully this small introduction helps you understand exactly how ThreeFold’s approach is so unique.
