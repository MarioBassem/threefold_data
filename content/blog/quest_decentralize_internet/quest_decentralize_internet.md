Tim Berners-Lee created the web server and browser in 1990. Back then, the web was of a free, rather decentralized nature in which no single entity was to control the access to it. With the client-server architecture of the web, however, centralization came about. [Nowadays](https://threefold.io/info/threefold#/threefold__why_intro?id=everyone-should-be-autonomous), the web as well as the Internet in general are highly centralized. There are only a few companies acting as gatekeepers to large parts of today’s Internet. The Internet as we know it is continuously [struggling with issues](https://theconversation.com/web-3-0-the-decentralised-web-promises-to-make-the-internet-free-again-113139) related to its centralized nature – from censorship and attacks on net neutrality to manipulation attempts from companies with [monopolistic power](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/28/who-owns-the-internet). These issues are systematic and major players like Amazon or Facebook are [benefitting](https://techmonitor.ai/boardroom/power-of-tech-companies) from the situation as it is. This business model is also highly reliant on centralized hyperscale [data centers](https://threefold.io/blog/post/data_leaks/) that also come with a whole set of issues, from their vulnerability and limited scalability to their extremely high energy consumption [and more](https://threefold.io/blog/post/threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure/).
