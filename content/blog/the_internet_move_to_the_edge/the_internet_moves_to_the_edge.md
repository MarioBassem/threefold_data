With new devices being connected every day and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), the metaverse and Web 3 gaining popularity, the [demand](https://www.cbre.com/en/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2021) for Internet capacity is booming. Already, these developments are shifting the [Internet’s “center of gravity”](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet) from its core to the edges in order to keep up with the growing demand. In an increasingly interconnected world, centralized cloud architectures are proving to be [bottlenecks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/03/25/demystifying-edge-technology/) hindering future growth.

<br/>

Here are some interesting numbers to emphasize the explosive growth of connected devices and the impending data explosion:

<br/>

* Back in 2018, [90% of global data creation](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet) took place within the two previous years.

<br/>

* In 2022, [4.95 billion people](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet) are using the Internet and about [2.5 quintillion bytes](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet) of data are created on a daily basis.

<br/>

* About 2 billion computers, 15 billion mobile devices and more than 22 billion IoT devices are [active worldwide](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet) on a daily basis.

<br/>

* By 2025, more than [1 billion people](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/index.html) and [75 billion IoT devices](https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/#:~:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20%2D%20number%20of%20connected%20devices%20worldwide%202015%2D2025&text=By%202025%2C%20forecasts%20suggest%20that,IoT%20installed%20base%20in%202019.) are expected to join the Internet.

<br/>

And yet, the expansion of Internet capacity still largely occurs in the same centralized and inefficient way. The client-server model of hyperscale data centers is unable to meet this rapidly growing demand due to high building and operational costs to support bandwidth, efficiency and cybersecurity requirements. As data centers are primarily built in the US, China and Europe, emerging countries have to be connected via sea cables which makes the model’s limitations for these countries particularly severe. And even in countries where many data centers are located, they are built in regions where land and electricity are as cheap as possible. Consequently, the bulk of data centers is still [far away](https://www.securityinfowatch.com/perimeter-security/physical-hardening/article/21263002/real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet) from where the majority of users and connected devices reside, and where huge amounts of data are generated that require processing – resulting in a [weak distribution](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/threefold__grid_valuation?id=what39s-the-potential-of-the-threefold-grid) of Internet capacity.

<br/>

About [175 Zettabytes](https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/our-story/rethink-data/files/Rethink_Data_Report_2020.pdf) of data will be created by 2025, as our economy becomes increasingly data driven. And this amount of data needs to be captured, stored and activated in a secure, efficient and high-performing way. So, the aforementioned technological use cases will not only [accelerate the demand](https://www.cbre.com/en/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2021) for Internet capacity but also require edge capabilities in order to run and scale successfully. In fact, this model poses one of the biggest obstacles to the success and spread of the Internet of Things and related applications. This will have to change. Actually, industry experts [expect 75%](https://www.i-scoop.eu/edge-computing-explained/) of data to be processed outside of the traditional data center or cloud model by 2025.

## The rise of the edge 

With emerging technologies spreading, computing needs to be pushed from centralized data centers to the edge to take these technologies to the next level. As more and more home appliances and devices become interconnected IoT devices, much more data will be generated within our homes. And this is just one example. Edge computing [tackles the shortcomings](https://www.i-scoop.eu/edge-computing-explained/) of the centralized model in terms of bandwidth, latency and autonomy. Applications, solutions and data have to be closer to the physical location they are being created and consumed to significantly reduce latency and allow these technologies to thrive and be ready for large-scale roll-outs.

<br/>

In 2022, the industry analyst company [IDC estimates](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48772522) the global spending on edge computing to increase by 14.8% compared to 2021, amounting to roughly $176 billion. By 2025, this number is predicted to reach about $274 billion.

<br/>

As the need for Internet capacity – specifically at the edge – is rapidly intensifying, a new approach to Internet infrastructure is clearly needed. This new approach has to be energy efficient, scalable and affordable – making intermediaries obsolete and connecting computers, smartphones and IoT devices directly to each other and to the Internet. A complete [architectural shift](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/03/25/demystifying-edge-technology/) needs to happen, away from centralized models and towards decentralizing the Internet.

## The paradigm shift for an interconnected future

ThreeFold is building the next-generation of Internet infrastructure. The [peer-to-peer nature](https://threefold.io/blog/post/p2p_web3/) of this decentralized open-source infrastructure, called the ThreeFold Grid, presents a paradigm shift. It removes the need of centralized servers and allows for the unlimited, flexible and on-demand expansion of the infrastructure. Anyone can participate in ThreeFold’s model by building or buying a 3Node, and connecting Internet capacity anywhere electricity and bandwidth are present – creating a fully [decentralized Internet](https://coincheckup.com/blog/threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet/).

<br/>

ThreeFold offers a powerful set of [compute](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zmachine?id=zmachine) primitives that provide the agility to create and deploy containers, Virtual Machines (VMs) and [Kubernetes](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zkube?id=zkube) environments at the edge. Having integrated all leading industry-standard tools, ThreeFold’s solution allows for a seamless migration of any digital workload. It enables developers to deploy VMs or to discover the future of cloud computing with [ZFlist](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__zos_fs?id=why-this-zflist-concept) – a game-changing Docker-compatible solution that is distributed across many mini VMs, positioning itself as the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads.

<br/>

And all data produced by these workloads can be stored in our [Quantum Safe Storage System](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/qsss/threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system) that is highly compatible with most storage tools (e.g. S3) and protocols (e.g. IPFS). Combined with peer-to-peer networking through our [Planetary Network](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/technology/threefold__planetary_network?id=planetary-network), applications can be hosted closer to where the data is being consumed, representing the ideal underlying layer for IoT networks, blockchain-based workloads and more to run and scale at the edge seamlessly, efficiently and privately.

<br/>

ThreeFold is the first full-stack, decentralized, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure in the world that combines compute in the form of highly-optimized containers, storage and network capacity in an all-in-one solution. With  more than [81 Petabytes](https://threefold.io/) of capacity distributed across thousands of 3Nodes and 74 countries as well as [plans](https://threefold.io/blog/post/connecting_the_dots/) to sponsor the expansion of the Internet to developing regions, ThreeFold is the foundation for a thriving interconnected future that is secure, borderless and at the edge.
