If you’ve seen [The Social Dilemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0), you know all too well that today, people are being turned into products. Everything we do online – all of the data we upload and all of our digital activities – is tracked and oftentimes used against us. Targeted advertising is just the beginning.
<br/>
<br/>
Personal data is used by algorithms to make incredible important decisions, like whether someone should receive financial or health support or benefits. In China, people are now even receiving “scores” for their behaviors. It sounds like Black Mirror, but it’s real life.
<br/>
<br/>
That’s the scary part. The good news is that things don’t have to be this way. ThreeFold is building the engine for an Internet where people can finally be data sovereign.
<br/>
<br/>
With [today’s Internet](https://threefold.io/info/threefold#/threefold__why_intro?id=everyone-should-be-autonomous), infrastructure is centralized. Companies provide services in exchange for your personal data, which is stored on servers in hyper-scale data centers owned by private companies.
<br/>
<br/>
In ThreeFold’s model, those servers are called [3Nodes](https://threefold.io/info/threefold#/threefold__3node), and rather than sitting inside centralized data centers, they sit inside the homes or offices (or small data centers) owned by independent people and organizations called [Farmers](https://threefold.io/info/threefold#/threefold__farming_intro?id=what-is-3node). But the data inside is owned by the person or persons who put it there. They maintain access right as well. From a technical standpoint, it is dispersed across 3Nodes by [an algorithm](https://info.threefold.io/#/threefold__part5_ultra_efficient_storage?id=the-space-algorithm-of-storage) that makes it such that nobody can access it.
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, people can finally be data sovereign, knowing their data is safe and secure and truly theirs.
