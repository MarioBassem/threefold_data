Dubai, UAE. Today at GITEX Technology Week, ThreeFold signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to cooperate in the CEEMA region on the implementation of the ThreeFold Grid, a neutral, low cost and low energy Internet on a global scale.

HPE provides their clients in the CEEMA region with the option to connect their computing and storage capacity to ThreeFold’s decentralized grid that supports ThreeFold’s mission to provide a responsible Internet, accessible to all.

HPE servers and storage hardwares have been certified to be used on ThreeFold’s Grid and HPE plans to build services to support the growth and usage of ThreeFold’s Grid which is in line with their edge cloud and blockchain strategy.

ThreeFold launched the Threefold Grid (on March 2018) with the support and collaboration from its community, and has already achieved sizable deployments of decentralized internet compute and storage capacity across the globe. Threefold's open source and localized IT capacity supports developers to build their current and future IT workloads with more cost and performance efficiencies than on current centralized cloud alternatives. By deploying their workloads on the ThreeFold Grid, developers also promote the expansion of a new digital peer-to-peer economy.

“This is a monumental step towards a new responsible internet and empowering a new digital economy“, Kristof De Spiegeleer, Visionary Co-Founder of ThreeFold.

_“ThreeFold has created one of the smartest Blockchain solutions we have come across”, said Johannes Koch: Vice President and HPE CEEMA Managing Director. “We are excited about our future cooperation”._
