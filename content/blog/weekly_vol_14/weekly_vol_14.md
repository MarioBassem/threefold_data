## Major ThreeFold News:

* Last week, ThreeFold was covered by **CoinCodex**: [ThreeFold: Host the Cloud At Your House](https://coincodex.com/article/14083/threefold-host-the-cloud-at-your-house/)

<br/>

* Members of the ThreeFold team and community gathered in Miami for **Bitcoin 2022**. Together with the FreeFlow Tribe, we also hosted a side event there with over 70 people to celebrate the **People‚Äôs Internet**.

<br/>

* We had a kickoff meeting for a project that aims to **help minorities and underprivileged US citizens** by creating passive income streams for US-based small holder farmers. We‚Äôll share more on this project when we can, so stay tuned!

<br/>

* Weynand participated in the **Fair Data Initiative** round table of our long-time partner [Solidaridad](https://threefold.io/partners/solidaridad), together with about 25 people from agricultural innovators and NGOs to banks and big tech companies. Read the full [update](https://forum.threefold.io/t/solidaridad-revival/2158/6?u=hannahcordes)!

<br/>

* *Also, check out this inspiring conversation between our co-founder Weynand and Jeroen from Solidaridad about¬† how to overcome the digital divide, fair data and more [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/conversation-between-weynand-threefold-partner-jeroen-douglas/2268).*

### Community updates:

* We have a truly amazing community! Get to know [Nelson](https://twitter.com/threefold_io/status/1512418985844916227?s=20&t=9jr1BAtpKT6zsWxW9euMGA) and [Dan](https://twitter.com/threefold_io/status/1513150808036061185?s=20&t=9jr1BAtpKT6zsWxW9euMGA) a little better, and check out [this node setup](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6915127377786253312/?actorCompanyId=13594159) from **Athus** in Brazil!

<br/>

* A big thank you to **Mike** for starting a community-led ThreeFold [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/4rh4AxRG), as well as to **Mik** and a few other ThreeFolders built out a second part of FAQs [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-faq-zero-os-v3-part-2/2620).

<br/>

* Also, we shared our [outreach strategy](https://forum.threefold.io/t/targeting-projects-communities-with-powerful-threefold-solutions/2646) for engaging with projects and communities across the web to show them how they can benefit from our solutions. Let us know what you think.

<br/>

* We added a [new category](https://forum.threefold.io/c/collaboration/industry-news/98) to the forum, to have a place where we can discuss news and developments across the industry as a community. Join the conversations!

<br/>

* Only **a handful of [L2](https://forum.threefold.io/t/procedure-to-register-your-l2-validator-node/1864) validator spots remain**. Already, L0 validator registrations exceed the spots available in this first batch, so please hurry up and follow the [verification process](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-threefold-validators-verification-process/2276) to secure your spot!

<br/>

*If you‚Äôre a community member interested in [sharing your story](https://forum.threefold.io/t/looking-for-farmer-stories-to-share-with-the-world/2398?u=hannahcordes) or [being featured](https://forum.threefold.io/t/looking-for-people-to-feature-in-threefold-content-its-super-simple/2636/3) in ThreeFold content, please reach out!*

### Technology Developments:

* We‚Äôre ready to submit the first milestone for the **DEVxDAO grant**. It‚Äôs a **1-click blockchain node deployment** solution that enables blockchains to provide their communities with an easy option for deploying nodes on top of the ThreeFold Grid, rather than running the nodes on centralized clouds.

<br/>

* We shared new videos of our **Knowledge Base series** explaining ThreeFold and the technology behind it. [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuegcGK1CSc&list=PLTGQlepPqwUXsvHsrm4pbQj0-DCa-Ud0c) the latest additions on Zero-OS, TF Chain and more!

<br/>

* Last week, the **EU‚Äôs ‚Äúunhosted wallets‚Äù** regulation made [headlines](https://cointelegraph.com/news/unhosted-is-unwelcome-eu-s-attack-on-noncustodial-wallets-is-part-of-a-larger-trend). ThreeFold has about 80% of the tooling to bring a decentralized answer to this regulation. Geert provided insights into our solution [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-solution-for-unhosted-wallets-regulation-in-eu/2621/3).

### ThreeFold Grid:¬†

* Last Friday, farming rewards for March 2022 were paid out.

<br/>

* And a quick reminder for those who haven‚Äôt migrated their **3Nodes from V2 to V3** yet: We‚Äôre a **decentralized community**, so we all need to ensure we‚Äôre powering the latest version of our technology for feature and security reasons. So, hurry up and follow the [migration process](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143?u=hannahcordes). We will soon be setting a deadline for V3 migration.

<br/>

* Titan orders continue to be delivered, although there is a delay in Europe due to components not being delivered on time. In case of specific questions about your Titan order, please reach out to the support team.

<br/>

Have a great week, ThreeFolders!¬† üôå¬†
