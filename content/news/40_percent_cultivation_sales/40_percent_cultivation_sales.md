A point that was raised within recent conversations was that the cultivation rewards could be improved for the Farmers. The current cultivation reward incentivizes Sales Channels to promote the usage of the ThreeFold Grid. 
<br/>
<br/>
We did this to create a decentralized business model based on selling capacity. So it important to understand that if the Farmer would sell their capacity directly, they would earn for sales of their capacity. 
<br/>
<br/>
- A farmer who does not sell capacity (3.0 model) gets 10% of cultivation.
- A farmer who does sell capacity gets 40% extra = 50% of the total fee.
<br/>
<br/>
For instance, a company could reach out to multiple farmers to do active sales for them and in return, they would get 40% of all cultivated tokens. This is ideal for the more "passive" farmers that only want to farm. 
<br/>
<br/>
This provides farmers with a very good model to do their own active sales, improving their cultivation returns by 5X (from 10% to 50%). To see what this would mean please set Cell C-20 at 10% and 50% on the ThreeFold Farming calculator.
