A point that was raised in recent conversations – with the community and internally – was that the cultivation rewards could be improved for Farmers. The updated cultivation reward now incentivizes Sales Channels to promote the usage of the ThreeFold Grid. 
<br/>
<br/>
We did this to create a decentralized business model based on selling capacity. So it is important to understand that if the Farmer would sell their capacity directly, they would earn for sales of their capacity.
<br/>
<br/>

- A farmer who does not sell capacity (3.0 model) gets 10% of cultivation
- A farmer who does sell capacity gets 40% extra = 50% of the total fee
<br/>
<br/>

For instance, a "third-party" company could reach out to multiple farmers to do active sales for them and in return they would get 40% of all cultivated tokens. This is ideal for the more "passive" farmers that only want to farm.
<br/>
<br/>

This provides farmers with a very good model to do their own active sales, improving their cultivation returns by 5X (from 10% to 50%). To see what this would mean please set Cell C-20 at 10% and 50% on
