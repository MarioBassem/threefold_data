Last week, we had a great brainstorm with the community around ThreeFold DMCC and different possible options for grid commercial offerings. Today we are happy to share the [recording of that call](https://vimeo.com/805551923/69eec7163f) and the [notes/recap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iku8ZyrwagxdcLJvbOmTm4OA_QVwV6BC-gtUiCLh2Cs/edit?usp=sharing).

<br/>

Additionally, weâ€™re announcing the [second brainstorm](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-dmcc-grid-commercialization-brainstorm-round-two/3835), which will take place next Wednesday, March 15th, at 17:00 CET / 11:00 EST.

<br/>

For this week, letâ€™s use the forum post and the notes document to build on or add ideas, and weâ€™ll reconvene next week to push this important effort forward. Weâ€™re planning the session for ~two hours. Looking forward to seeing you then!

<br/>

_Note: We had to reschedule from Tuesday to Wednesday because of the availability of our team members. Hopefully you can make it then!_
