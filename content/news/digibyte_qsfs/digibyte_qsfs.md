Last May, DigiByte Foundation and ThreeFold partnered with a collective vision of introducing secure consumer and enterprise-level projects on ThreeFold's peer-to-peer grid. The two are in the final stages of testing decentralized DGB node deployment on ThreeFold's P2P architecture, and today they are announcing their first major step towards achieving their vision – a quantum-safe storage solution developed by ThreeFold, using DigiByte's ultra-secure blockchain.

## Background

​ThreeFold is decentralizing the Internet and Cloud industry. Today, data has become the most valuable commodity on earth – and with significant data leakages exposing the data of billions, it is clear that a more decentralized and secure Internet infrastructure is needed. ThreeFold started from scratch on a Linux Kernel and created a stateless and light-weight operating system, Zero OS, that removes all the unnecessary complexity of contemporary OS’s and enables a “zero people” (autonomous) and peer-to-peer Internet.
<br/>
<br/>
DigiByte is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications, proof of authenticity and secure authentication. With 5 different consensus mechanisms that provide the highest level of security, and with an unbreakable track record over 7 years of existence, DigiByte arguably holds the most secure immutable ledger on the market.
<br/>
<br/>
ThreeFold, together with members of the DigiByte Foundation and some seasoned professionals from  the cloud storage business, will bring forward a quantum-safe storage solution for enterprises and consumers. This is a powerful collaboration as ThreeFold's quantum-safe storage will integrate with DigiByte's blockchain to store and access data in a way that cannot be counterfeited, duplicated, or hacked.
<br/>
<br/>
"Data has become the digital gold and oil, the most valuable commodity on earth," says Rudy Bouwman, secretary and vice-chair of the DigiByte Foundation. "As gold is stored in a vault, data needs an equally-secure digital safe haven. And like oil, you need large storage capacity to handle large volumes. Today, the collaboration between ThreeFold and the DigiByte Foundation brings forward exactly that – a safe and secure location for people and enterprises around the world to store and access their most precious asset."

## A Game-Changing Storage Solution Comes Alive

The Quantum Safe Filesystem (QSFS), built by ThreeFold and now brought to the world today in collaboration with DigiByte Foundation, is unlike any storage solution that exists on today's market, bringing quantum-safe archiving, back-up, and long-term cold storage with self-healing capabilities.
<br/>
<br/>
QSFS is a mechanism to mount any file system, in any format, on the ThreeFold Grid in a quantum-secure way. It is compatible with 95% of all industry storage solutions such as S3, CIFS, NFS, as well as distributed file sharing protocols such as IPFS and Hypercore. This will permit enterprises to benefit from a decentralized and secure storage solution, compatible with what they are already using today. QSFS enables append-only storage management with the highest security levels for any object format currently present in the IT industry.
<br/>
<br/>
Even the most powerful computers won’t be able to hack into this solution, as no single node would contain the full object files. An object file is anything that can be stored, such as a document, recording, or picture. A dispersed storage algorithm breaks the object files into equations and stores them on different nodes – meaning the data itself is not even being stored. Only users can reconstruct the equations stored within that infrastructure via their private keys. The algorithm enables 20x less overhead than classic solutions and clear security benefits.
<br/>
<br/>
​To bring an even deeper level of security, QSFS will use DigiByte's blockchain to create a 100% secure public record of activities. A quantum safe storage system paired with an ultra-secure blockchain brings an unprecedented combination to the market for enterprises and for their customers.
<br/>
<br/>
“This is a really exciting moment! Together with the DigiByte Foundation and business professionals, we’re decentralizing storage in a quantum-safe way, combining proven enterprise technologies with the most secure blockchain we found,” says Weynand Kuijpers, Co-Founder of ThreeFold. “But most importantly – this is a solution built by people, for people.” 

## So, What's Next?

The Quantum Safe Filesystem is already live on ThreeFold testnet and will be ready on mainnet later in Q2 2021. Members of the DigiByte Foundation, ThreeFold, and professionals from the corporate enterprise world are working to bring this incredible and much-needed solution to the market as soon as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
QSFS is the first in a series of upcoming announcements showcasing how DigiByte Foundation and ThreeFold will work together with the professional community to create, launch, promote, and operate new digital services based on their collective technology stack.​​​​​​
