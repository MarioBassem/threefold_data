We wanted to update the community that Liquid, an exchange on which TFT is listed, [shared this morning](https://twitter.com/Liquid_Global/status/1428176357515612165?s=09) that warm wallets on the exchange were compromised in a hack.

<br/>
**It appears that Stellar-based assets (e.g. TFT) were not stolen, and no action is needed at this time.** But in the meantime deposits and withdrawals have been suspended.
<br/>

Liquid is investigating and will provide updates as they have them. We‚Äôve also reached out to them directly and will share more as we know. üôè
