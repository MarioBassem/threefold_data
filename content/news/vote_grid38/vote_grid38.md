In case you missed the note from Sabrina earlier today (in the main chat):

<br/>

Dear friends,

<br/>

Two weeks ago, we deployed the TF Grid 3.8 on testnet. You can read all about the new features and bugfixes/improvements in our [release notes](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-grid-v3-8-release-notes/3757). 

<br/>

We would like to go live on mainnet with Grid 3.8 on Monday February 20th, but first the upgrade needs to pass the DAO voting. You can vote by logging into [the dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/), selecting your farm and clicking on â€˜Daoâ€™ under the Portal menu. 

<br/>

Voting ends on Friday February 17th.

<br/>

Cheers,
The TF Team
