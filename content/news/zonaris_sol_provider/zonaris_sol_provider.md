We‚Äôre pleased to [share](https://forum.threefold.io/t/zonaris-approved-as-solution-provider/3802) that [Zonaris](https://www.zonaris.io/) has been [approved by a DAO vote](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftfchain.grid.tf#/explorer/query/0x1780fd8132fb862054f38386ea4a0147f8a17d2e6ccd342f579d67857b53fa13) to become a solution provider on the ThreeFold Grid. Thanks to those who voted and congrats to the team at Zonaris!

Not sure what a solution provider is? A solution provider offers a solution on the ThreeFold Grid and receives 50% of the TFT utilization revenues from the workload related to the solution. You can dig further into this topic and how to become a solution provider [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-solution-provider-and-sales-channel/3746).

<br/>

_We highly encourage those in the community who are building solutions on top of ThreeFold to [apply to become a solution provider](https://forum.threefold.io/c/dao/solution-provider-proposals/115)!_
