bio: After an education in electrical engineering, I got drawn into IT, then called Data Processing. and wrote my first COBOL programm 1969. I stayed in this industry till I retired. I belive that even with an technical background, sales is very important. If you find no customer for your ideas, products or solution one can not sustain. A good  amount of curiosity is a good base to remain active and vigilant. My aspiration is to stay level with the developments in the IT industry. 
excerpt: A healthy mix of work and play keeps me going. I like old cars and to work on them, and chocolate.
