bio: Kyle has spent the last 10 years working in/on sustainability projects ranging from large scale commercial solar farms to rural NGO tuberculosis control programs. He has worked on a number of startups and founder of EVERA, a Dubai-based organization trying to make mobility more sustainable. Everyday he tries very hard not to be an idiot, or take himself too seriously. Sometimes he is successful. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold I believe in ThreeFold Foundation because I believe in the people behind the movement.
