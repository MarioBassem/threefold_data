bio: In 1999, I started my own business in the market of recruitment, the time internet got introduced in the business world. Wicked problems for matching talent to job opportunities were faced. I realised we could do far better by giving back control over personal data to the individual and start redefining business processes and businesses. Therefore I shared, learned and connected myself. I connected myself to initiatives for knowledge sharing, networking and innovation. Because I do believe it is the responsibility and the opportunity of our generation to get the appropriate digitale infrastructure available to move to our next level of prosperity. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold Thanks to ThreeFold Foundation robust technology comes available in good organisational design. A design that takes in account that humankind strives for prosperity for all.
