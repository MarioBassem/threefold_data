bio: Having worked for a multinational technology company, I have 35+ years of experience in the ICT market. Change was the only constant, not only in technology but also in the political and economic environment especially in the emerging markets which I served. The greatest gift was the privilege to work with multicultural teams in several regional management functions. Nowadays I am proud to pass on some of my experience as lecturer at an educational college. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it; Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it” – This quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has accompanied me throughout my life. I view the Threefold Foundation of being the intersection between technology and sustainability, thus helping coming generations finding the world a good place to live. I am excited and passionate about the vision, values and ideas of the Foundation.
