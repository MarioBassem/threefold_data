bio: I worked 35 years for HP/HPE as sales/product manager/EMEA Director for Business Critical Server Business,last 10 years as EMEA Mission Critical Server Presales Manager, where I managed an EMEA team of presales specialists who nursed new technologies entering the market as well as managed mature technologies that faced declining business. I retired end of 2017, still eagerly following new technologies as I am an engineer with a Mechanical Engineering diploma from TU Graz, Austria. I am married, have 2 adult daughters, love computers and DIY repairs of any kind, my motorbike and Pilates and engage myself in charity clubs since 30 years. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold I learned about ThreeFold from Owen Kemp and Wolfgang Wittmer and was fascinated immediately by the TF approach. Although being a manager almost all of the time of my business life, I am “technology affine” and always interested in new technologies and advances in IT technology, which I follow closely. In HPE, for example, I was also an evangelist for MDC – Memory Driven Compute – a fundamentally new approach to compute architecture based on HP’s famous “The Machine” lab project (see www.labs.hpe.com/the-machine ). I like the idea to build a digitally responsible internet as well as taking social responsibility to bring affordable compute resources to the world, especially the 3rd world. I followed grid and blockchain technologies from the early days (on a high level, not as a programmer, which I am not) and I am happy to see that there are now realistically useable and reasonable approaches like TF proposes. I understand that this is all still in early stages and this is why I want to become a TF Ambassador, Contributing to the community and helping to find business opportunities and other potential contributors and supporters in my own personal network. I am eager to become part of the TF community to learn more about this exciting new approach.
