bio: Equality of opportunity is a fundamental right in my opinion. So is privacy that goes beyond being a personal right as it is a necessity for democracy to function. A better world is something that starts with yourself. Technology today does not sufficiently suppport my personal believes of how a bettter world might look like, especially not how it is made available to the majority of the world population. I'm a nerd and proud of it so let's start doing what is right.
