bio: Roel's main focus in life is positive growth. In all aspects, he seeks to push boundaries that help him, the people around him, or even people he does not even know. He's a firm believer of the ripple effect; the more positive ripples you send out, the more people are likely to be affected by them, to in their turn replicate the ripples. Being an Explorer is one of those ripples.
